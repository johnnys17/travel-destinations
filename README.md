**Travel Destinations**

A responsive and visually engaging website for a fictional travel agency, developed as part of my full-stack web development journey. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and layout design using Flexbox, featuring interactive hover animations, a card-based design for three popular destinations—Paris, Tokyo, and New York—and "Explore Now" buttons for enhanced user interaction. The site is optimized for a seamless user experience across devices, with a modern aesthetic that highlights my attention to detail and design sensibility.

Built to refine my front-end development capabilities, this webpage serves as a key piece in my portfolio as I pursue a career in web development. The use of Flexbox ensures a flexible, responsive layout, while hover effects demonstrate dynamic styling. Future enhancements could include JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., a search function) or additional sections like a blog or booking system.
